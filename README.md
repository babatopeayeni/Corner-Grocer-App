# Project Reflection

## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
I was developing an advising assistance software to help academic advisors at ABCU manage and retrieve course information efficiently.

## How did you approach the problem?
I approached the problem by designing a command-line program in C++ that reads course data from a file, stores it in an appropriate data structure (a map for quick lookup), and provides various functionalities through a user menu.

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I overcame roadblocks by breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, seeking help from online resources and classmates, and thoroughly testing each part of the program to ensure it worked as expected.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project taught me the importance of planning and using the right data structures to ensure efficiency and scalability. It also highlighted the need for clear user interfaces and robust error handling.

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I learned to write more maintainable code by using clear naming conventions, adding inline comments, and modularizing my code. This experience emphasized the importance of writing adaptable code that can easily accommodate future changes.
